# DynMacro
This is some of the material I covered for my course "Dynamic Macroeconomic Models: Theory and Practice" taught at the University of Konstanz. The course cover several topics in the macroeconomics of DSGE models (master/first year PhD level).

In this repo you will find slides and problem sets, some of them in Matlab/Dynare. Should you find any typo/omission etc. please let me know.
